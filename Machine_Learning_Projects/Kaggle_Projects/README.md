This repository contains my kaggle projects.


- [Ad-click Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/konchada/logistic-vs-random-forest-model-for-ad-click) - The goal of the project was to predict how likely a user is going to click on a Ad. I have used and compared logistic regression with random forest model in this project.
